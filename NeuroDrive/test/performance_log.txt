[Day 1 ‚Äì Webcam FPS Test]
- Device: Laptop Webcam
- Lighting 1 (Bright): 30.2 FPS (average)
- Lighting 2 (Dim): 29.7 FPS (average)
- Observations:
  ‚Ä¢ No major FPS drop under dim lighting
  ‚Ä¢ Startup dip (once): 4.90 FPS ‚Äî ignored in avg
  ‚Ä¢ Webcam runs smoothly and reliably
- Status:  Ready for Day 2 tests


[Day 2 ‚Äì Face & Eye Detection Test]
- Device: Laptop Webcam
- Test Mode: Real-time detection using face_eye_detect.py
- Lighting: Normal indoor lighting
- Observations:
  ‚Ä¢ Face and eye detection consistent in both lighting conditions
  ‚Ä¢ Shows "Drowsy" if both eyes closed for more than 2 seconds
  ‚Ä¢ Detection fails momentarily if face is turned >45¬∞
- Detection Status:
  ‚Ä¢ Eyes:  Detected accurately
  ‚Ä¢ Face:  Stable

-  Bugs / Issues:
  ‚Ä¢ Shows Drowsy even when one eye is closed(left eye)
  ‚Ä¢ Detection skips frames if face is partially occluded (e.g., hand near face)
  ‚Ä¢ No warnings when the face is not detected

- Status:  Passed baseline detection tests; ready for Day 3 integration


[Day 3 ‚Äì Bug Reporting & Re-Testing]
Device: Laptop Webcam
Script: main.py (post-integration testing)
Lighting Conditions: Bright & Dim
Test Focus: Functional bug validation, retesting

Observations:
‚Ä¢ Ran multiple real-time test scenarios
‚Ä¢ Reported bug to the team for code-level fix
‚Ä¢ Retested after fix ‚Äî detection accuracy improved
‚Ä¢ Reported speaking/singing bug
‚Ä¢ Team is working on integrating head movement compensation to avoid false alerts

Detection Status:
‚Ä¢ Eyes:  Fixed one-eye bug
‚Ä¢ Face:  Stable under varied angles

Bugs / Issues Resolved:
‚Ä¢ False positive for one-eye closure
‚Ä¢ Detection stability improved under quick eye movements

Bugs/Issues:
False Drowsy detection when the subject is speaking or singing ‚Äî under review

Status:  Completed system-level retest | Bug fixes in progress


[Day 4 ‚Äì FPS & Regression Testing]
Device: Laptop Webcam

Script: main.py

Lighting: Bright & Dim

FPS Observed: ~27.8 FPS (average)

Observations:
‚Ä¢ System maintained stable FPS in both lighting conditions
‚Ä¢ No major frame drops or UI lags
‚Ä¢ Retested all detection functions ‚Äî consistent results
‚Ä¢ Minor bugs found and reported 
Detection Status:
‚Ä¢ Eyes:  Responsive
‚Ä¢ Face:  Smooth under moderate movement

 Bugs / Issues:
‚Ä¢ Minor flicker in UI overlay during quick head turns

Status:  Final checks completed | Ready for Day-5 integration


[Day 5 ‚Äì Trigger Timing testing]

Device: Laptop Webcam + Sample Videos
Script: main.py
Lighting: Standard Indoor
FPS Observed: ~28.1 FPS (average)
Latency: ~25 ms/frame

Lighting: Dim
FPS Observed: ~27.3 FPS
Latency: ~24.9 ms (average)

Sample videos:
‚Ä¢ FPS observed: ~46.6 FPS
‚Ä¢ Latency : ~26.94 ms


Observations:
‚Ä¢ Tested across real video scenarios + live webcam
‚Ä¢ Dim and normal lighting tested
‚Ä¢ Eye closure thresholds and timing logic verified
‚Ä¢ Trigger time (when drowsiness starts) is now correctly recorded
‚Ä¢ System stable with real-time webcam input
‚Ä¢ Regression-tested FPS and latency in realistic dim-light use cases
‚Ä¢ System reliably triggers alert after 0.6‚Äì0.7 seconds of continuous eye closure
‚Ä¢ Frame rate and latency stable under low light


Status:
Field testing in realistic video scenarios completed
Ready for Day 6 full-system evaluation

[Day 6 ‚Äì Performance Evaluation & Distraction Detection]

Device: Laptop Webcam + Sample Videos
Script: main.py (Distraction detection module integrated)
Lighting: Normal Indoor light conditions
Testing Type: Real-time and sample video distraction logging


Webcam Input:
‚Ä¢ üìä Average FPS: 33.21
‚Ä¢ üìä Average Latency: 21.72 ms/frame

Sample Video Input:
‚Ä¢ üìä Average FPS: 32.15
‚Ä¢ üìä Average Latency: 26.18 ms/frame
‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor variation in latency due to frame decoding

Final Observations:
‚Ä¢ No major FPS drops observed under any test case
‚Ä¢ Latency remains within acceptable bounds (below 30ms)
‚Ä¢ Average time taken to trigger drowsiness: 0.50 seconds  
‚Ä¢ Logging is real-time
‚Ä¢ Duplicate logging issue (e.g., trigger time printed twice) resolved in final version
‚Ä¢ All thresholds (drowsy triggers, distraction detection) verified
‚Ä¢ Distraction (Looking Left/Right/Down) detected accurately in most frames
‚Ä¢ Pose updates logged in real-time with minimal delay
‚Ä¢ EAR values stable and responsive
‚Ä¢ Eye status detection (open/closed) consistent and precise
‚Ä¢ No overlap between drowsy and distraction alerts


Status:
‚Ä¢ System shows stable real-time performance
‚Ä¢ Testing Completed
‚Ä¢ Final performance confirmed across all test modes
‚Ä¢ Ready for project closure, documentation, or demo
