[Day 1 – Webcam FPS Test]
- Device: Laptop Webcam
- Lighting 1 (Bright): 30.2 FPS (average)
- Lighting 2 (Dim): 29.7 FPS (average)
- Observations:
  • No major FPS drop under dim lighting
  • Startup dip (once): 4.90 FPS — ignored in avg
  • Webcam runs smoothly and reliably
- Status:  Ready for Day 2 tests


[Day 2 – Face & Eye Detection Test]
- Device: Laptop Webcam
- Test Mode: Real-time detection using face_eye_detect.py
- Lighting: Normal indoor lighting
- Observations:
  • Face and eye detection consistent in both lighting conditions
  • Shows "Drowsy" if both eyes closed for more than 2 seconds
  • Detection fails momentarily if face is turned >45°
- Detection Status:
  • Eyes:  Detected accurately
  • Face:  Stable

-  Bugs / Issues:
  • Shows Drowsy even when one eye is closed(left eye)
  • Detection skips frames if face is partially occluded (e.g., hand near face)
  • No warnings when the face is not detected

- Status:  Passed baseline detection tests; ready for Day 3 integration


[Day 3 – Bug Reporting & Re-Testing]
Device: Laptop Webcam
Script: main.py (post-integration testing)
Lighting Conditions: Bright & Dim
Test Focus: Functional bug validation, retesting

Observations:
• Ran multiple real-time test scenarios
• Reported bug to the team for code-level fix
• Retested after fix — detection accuracy improved
• Reported speaking/singing bug
• Team is working on integrating head movement compensation to avoid false alerts

Detection Status:
• Eyes:  Fixed one-eye bug
• Face:  Stable under varied angles

Bugs / Issues Resolved:
• False positive for one-eye closure
• Detection stability improved under quick eye movements

Bugs/Issues:
False Drowsy detection when the subject is speaking or singing — under review

Status:  Completed system-level retest | Bug fixes in progress


[Day 4 – FPS & Regression Testing]
Device: Laptop Webcam

Script: main.py

Lighting: Bright & Dim

FPS Observed: ~27.8 FPS (average)

Observations:
• System maintained stable FPS in both lighting conditions
• No major frame drops or UI lags
• Retested all detection functions — consistent results
• Minor bugs found and reported 
Detection Status:
• Eyes:  Responsive
• Face:  Smooth under moderate movement

 Bugs / Issues:
• Minor flicker in UI overlay during quick head turns

Status:  Final checks completed | Ready for Day-5 integration
