[Day 1 – Webcam FPS Test]
- Device: Laptop Webcam
- Lighting 1 (Bright): 30.2 FPS (average)
- Lighting 2 (Dim): 29.7 FPS (average)
- Observations:
  • No major FPS drop under dim lighting
  • Startup dip (once): 4.90 FPS — ignored in avg
  • Webcam runs smoothly and reliably
- Status:  Ready for Day 2 tests


[Day 2 – Face & Eye Detection Test]
- Device: Laptop Webcam
- Test Mode: Real-time detection using face_eye_detect.py
- Lighting: Normal indoor lighting
- Observations:
  • Face and eye detection consistent in both lighting conditions
  • Shows "Drowsy" if both eyes closed for more than 2 seconds
  • Detection fails momentarily if face is turned >45°
- Detection Status:
  • Eyes:  Detected accurately
  • Face:  Stable
-  Bugs / Issues:
  • Shows Drowsy even when one eye is closed(left eye)
  • Detection skips frames if face is partially occluded (e.g., hand near face)
  • No warnings when the face is not detected

- Status:  Passed baseline detection tests; ready for Day 3 integration



[Day 3 – Bug Reporting & Re-Testing]
Device: Laptop Webcam
Script: main.py (post-integration testing)
Lighting Conditions: Bright & Dim
Test Focus: Functional bug validation, retesting

Observations:
• Ran multiple real-time test scenarios
• Reported bug to the team for code-level fix
• Retested after fix — detection accuracy improved
• Reported speaking/singing bug
• Team is working on integrating head movement compensation to avoid false alerts

Detection Status:
• Eyes:  Fixed one-eye bug
• Face:  Stable under varied angles

Bugs / Issues Resolved:
• False positive for one-eye closure
• Detection stability improved under quick eye movements

Bugs/Issues:
False Drowsy detection when the subject is speaking or singing — under review

Status:  Completed system-level retest | Bug fixes in progress



[Day 4 – FPS & Regression Testing]
Device: Laptop Webcam
Script: main.py
Lighting: Bright & Dim
FPS Observed: ~27.8 FPS (average)

Observations:
• System maintained stable FPS in both lighting conditions
• No major frame drops or UI lags
• Retested all detection functions — consistent results
• Minor bugs found and reported 
Detection Status:
• Eyes:  Responsive
• Face:  Smooth under moderate movement

 Bugs / Issues:
• Minor flicker in UI overlay during quick head turns

Status:  Final checks completed | Ready for Day-5 integration



[Day 5 – Trigger Timing testing]

Device: Laptop Webcam + Sample Videos
Script: main.py
Lighting: Standard Indoor
FPS Observed: ~28.1 FPS (average)
Latency: ~25 ms/frame

Lighting: Dim
FPS Observed: ~27.3 FPS
Latency: ~24.9 ms (average)

Sample videos:
• FPS observed: ~46.6 FPS
• Latency : ~26.94 ms

Observations:
• Tested across real video scenarios + live webcam
• Dim and normal lighting tested
• Eye closure thresholds and timing logic verified
• Trigger time (when drowsiness starts) is now correctly recorded
• System stable with real-time webcam input
• Regression-tested FPS and latency in realistic dim-light use cases
• System reliably triggers alert after 0.6–0.7 seconds of continuous eye closure
• Frame rate and latency stable under low light

Status:
Field testing in realistic video scenarios completed
Ready for Day 6 full-system evaluation

[Day 6 – Performance Evaluation & Distraction Detection]

Device: Laptop Webcam + Sample Videos
Script: main.py (Distraction detection module integrated)
Lighting: Normal Indoor light conditions
Testing Type: Real-time and sample video distraction logging

Webcam Input:
•  Average FPS: 33.21
•  Average Latency: 21.72 ms/frame

Sample Video Input:
•  Average FPS: 32.15
•  Average Latency: 26.18 ms/frame
•  Minor variation in latency due to frame decoding

Final Observations:
• No major FPS drops observed under any test case
• Latency remains within acceptable bounds (below 30ms)
• Average time taken to trigger drowsiness: 0.50 seconds  
• Logging is real-time
• Duplicate logging issue (e.g., trigger time printed twice) resolved in final version
• All thresholds (drowsy triggers, distraction detection) verified
• Distraction (Looking Left/Right/Down) detected accurately in most frames
• Pose updates logged in real-time with minimal delay
• EAR values stable and responsive
• Eye status detection (open/closed) consistent and precise
• No overlap between drowsy and distraction alerts

Status:
• System shows stable real-time performance
• Testing Completed
• Final performance confirmed across all test modes
• Ready for project closure, documentation, or demo
